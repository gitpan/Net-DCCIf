Net::DCCIf
-=-=-=-=-=

This module is an interface to a DCC daemon - dccifd.

The daemon speeds up dcc processing (no constantly launching the C program),
and this interface simplifies access to that daemon.

This code copies ideas from the dcc distributed dccif.pl script, but
is a complete re-write of that code.

This is free software, you may use it and redistribute it under the same
terms as perl itself.
